<p class="full-bloom-paragraph1">In November 2022, I embarked on a captivating journey of artistic exploration and technological innovation through a real-time audio/video processing project. This fusion of <span class="highlighted-text"> art and technology</span>, achieved using the Signal Culture Applications, gave rise to a live processing performance. The project delved into a perspective on femininity, aiming to shed light on a contrasting reality. The focal point of this immersive experience was a recurring motif of flowers, chosen as a symbolic element that represented the traditional "sensibility" often attributed to women. This juxtaposition became the canvas on which the performance unfolded, the expected and the unconventional.</p>

<p class="full-bloom-paragraph2" >The real-time audio and video processing was juxtaposed with vintage commercials from the 70s, promoting household appliances designed for stay-at-home moms. This inclusion served as a reminder of the expectations and stereotypes that women have historically faced, revealing the contrast between societal ideals and the actual realities of female existence. The jarring soundscapes, together with the unsettling video processing, introduced an undercurrent of discomfort, providing a hint of terror to underscore the project's message. In essence, this project depicted the double standards and complexities surrounding <span class="highlighted-text"> femininity</span>, challenging conventional narratives and encouraging viewers to contemplate the multifaceted aspects of womanhood.</p>
